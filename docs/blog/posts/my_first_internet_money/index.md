# My first internet money.

The following is the initial post about the very first internet money that I've made.
Although I'm not proud to say that this achievement comes a bit too late in life but none the less
I do think it's important for any developer out there what it means to build a SaaS without any of the usual
BS you find in posts such as this. The great part of having my own blog is that I get to talk about this subjects without constraints.

## TLDR: why should you read this?
To be perfectly honest ... you probably shouldn't. This isn't going to be one of those blogs where you get 
a lot of good advice on how to success. This is more of a records of the struggles I gone through to get enough 
value for my users that someone was willing to pay money.

It should be noted at this point, that my background up to this point was mainly focused on Machine Learning pipelines for internal
software. This means... I don't have the experience of keeping a system running reliably for months or even years at the time of this writing. 
Usually in the boring side of ML, pipelines suddenly appear out of thing air just to give a manager of some higher-up enough data to 
back up or disprove an argument.
