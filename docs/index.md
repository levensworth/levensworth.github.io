Hey! I'm Santiago Bassani.

</div>


I'm a software engineer and educator from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·, currently based in Dublin, Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª. With over 7 years of experience in the tech industry, I've had the chance to work with both large tech companies and startups. As 
a Machine Learning engineer, I am skilled in various languages and technologies, including Python, Java, Spark, TensorFlow, and FastAPI. I have a strong passion for creating innovative and user-friendly software and am a 
dedicated lifelong learner, always eager to explore new knowledge. In my spare time, I enjoy delving into Neuro Evolution, robotics, traveling, and films! My ultimate goal is to find happiness in my work and in myself. While I 
aspire to start my own company someday, I'm still figuring out what that venture will be. For now, I'm committed to learning and growing as a software engineer.
